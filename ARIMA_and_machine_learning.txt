Attempts to model real-world time series using a combination of
linear modelling for the time-series and non-linear modelling for
the error series.

Using ARIMA and MLP, SVR.

AR, MA and ARIMA are flexible, light but purely linear models.

Artificial Neural Networks are flexible and data driven models that
are able to perform nonlinear modeling.

Only ANN may not be enough for real-world TS due to misspecification,
under-fitting or overfitting.

That's where hybrid models combining stat models and ANN truly fucking
shines.
They use the modelling of the residuals series.
Non linear combination of these models usually wields better results than
a linear combination.

System functions in 3 steps:
1. Linear model employed to perform forecasts.
2. Residuals are modelled by a nonlinear model.
3. Supervised learning model employed to perform
combination of the forecasts.
Those used are MLP and SVR.

DATA:
Canadian Lynx, Sunspot, BP/US exchange rate, Colorado River Flow,
Airline passengers, Star Brightness.

The lag variable is a key point for the proposed method.
lag give data from the subset (1,lag) where lag < LMax
(2,LMax) where LMax is a cross-correlation
between TS and ES obtained from the forecasts of the linear model.

This method is flexible because it is able to select the number of forecasts
required to improve the combination of L and NL model.

2 versions proposed
under the nomenclature Mc(Ml,Mnl) (combi(linear,non-linear))
MLP(ARIMA,SVR) and SVR(ARIMA,MLP).

Time to check Gaussian Kernel and RBF kernel stupid inbred fuckface.

Exchange rate are weekly series and test set over 1 month, 6 months, 12 month.
